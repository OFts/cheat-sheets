# Cheat Cheets

This is just a set of cheat sheets created from content I have found in different sources on the internet. From documentation to videos on YT. 

Most of the repository content consists of .md or .markdown files in which some explanation is given about the functions of the different tools I have learned and researched. 

The content, for the most part, are personal annotations that often do not follow a defined order or structure. So for a better reference in each file I attach the source of information to which I resorted.
